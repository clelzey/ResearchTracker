# Research Tracker
### A Chrome Extension 

This customized Chrome Extension can be used to save website
links when conduction research without the need to create
bookmarks. Saved items are saved as easily accessed links. A
double click on "DELETE ALL" will remove all the saved links.
Information for the links are stored in the browser's local
storage for persistence across multiple browser windows.

#### Deployment steps
Download via zip and extract all files. Save folder in an easily
accessible folder, I suggest 'C:/dev/'. Open your Chrome browser
and navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
Make sure that Developer Mode is toggled on. Once Developer Mode
is on three options will become available. Select 'Load unpacked'
and navigate to the extension's saved location in the file explore that opens.
Highlight the folder and use the 'Select Folder' button. The 
'Research Tracker' extension is now accessible from the puzzle piece
icon.
